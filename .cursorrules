### Code Implementation Guidelines

Follow these rules when you write code:

- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- Use zod for form validation.
- Build forms with proper validation and error handling.
- Build modern, responsive, and accessible UI components, focusing on Shadcn UI, making it look modern, beautiful, sleek, and functional.
- Build PDF documents with proper formatting and styling, focusing on react-pdf, making it look modern, beautiful, sleek, and functional.
