# AI Code Generation Workshop

This repository contains starter code and prompts for a hands-on workshop on using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation. The workshop demonstrates how to effectively leverage AI to assist in software development tasks, from basic code generation to complex application development.

## Repository Structure

- `basic-code-generation/`: Entry-level examples demonstrating fundamental code generation tasks

  - `python-demo/`: Python examples for basic code generation
  - `frontend-demo/`: Next.js/React examples for basic frontend code generation
  - `prompts.md`: Curated prompts for basic code generation tasks

- `complex-code-generation/`: Advanced examples showing more sophisticated code generation scenarios

  - `python-demo/`: Complex Python application examples
  - `frontend-demo/`: Advanced Next.js/React application examples
  - `data-processing/`: Data processing and analysis examples
  - `prompts.md`: Advanced prompts for complex code generation tasks

- `nextjs-template/`: A starter Next.js template for frontend development exercises

## Purpose

This workshop repository is designed to:

1. Demonstrate practical applications of AI-assisted code generation
2. Provide hands-on experience with LLM prompting for code generation
3. Show the progression from basic to complex code generation tasks
4. Offer real-world examples in both Python and JavaScript/TypeScript environments

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Choose either the basic or complex code generation track based on your experience level
3. Follow the prompts in the respective `prompts.md` files
4. Use the provided starter code as a base for your AI-assisted development

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python and JavaScript/TypeScript
- Familiarity with React and Next.js frameworks
- Access to an LLM service (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

## Workshop Structure

The workshop is organized in increasing complexity:

1. Basic code generation examples for fundamental programming tasks
2. Complex scenarios involving full application development
3. Each section contains both Python and frontend development examples
